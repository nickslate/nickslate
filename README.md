### Guten Tag.  
I'm a person who exists.  Call me nickslate.
I make bad ideas into worse realities.  This is where many of those bad ideas (and their manifestations) live.

Random Quotes (or whatever):

Murphy's Eighth Law: If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.

Another Murphy's Law: If at first you do succeed, try not to look astonished.


Want to contact me?  Too bad, the sheer amount of spam has forced me to close my public inbox.  Thanks, spammers.
